# TJSON

A lightweight, more forgiving alternative to JSON for Haxe projects â€” especially great for mods, config files, or anything alike.

This is a fork of the original [TJSON](https://github.com/JWambaugh/TJSON) parser, updated and cleaned up for use in **Lime/OpenFL/FNF-style projects**. It's designed to be more resilient and user-friendly than standard `haxe.Json`.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- âœ… Comments! Supports `//` and `/* block comments */`
- âœ… Keys **donâ€™t need quotes**
- âœ… Strings can use **single or double quotes**
- âœ… Commas are **optional**
- âœ… Trailing commas **wonâ€™t crash** your file
- âœ… Helpful error messages with line numbers

---

## ðŸ’¾ Installation

Install via haxelib by running the following in your command line:

`haxelib git tjson https://github.com/moxie-coder/TJSON/`

Depending on your setup, if you're updating for legacy projects, be sure to add the following to your .hxml file:

`-lib tjson`

Otherwise, include this in your Project.xml as such

`<haxelib name="tjson"/>`

Make sure it does *not* have `version="1.4.0"` in it. Simple as that!
